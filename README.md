# eyersee

IRC client as a [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) app/extension.

```
This project is very much a hack and your mileage will vary, and likely be 0.
```

## getting started

The only way to install this current is from source. If this scares you, this project is not yet for you.

You will need:

* nodejs
* google chrome (latest version, maybe even the dev channel)
* some basic reasoning skills

Install:

* `git clone` this repo
* `npm install` to get some dependencies
* `make`
* `load unpacked extension` in Chrome on the generated `build` directory

You should now have an icon in your Chrome Apps (or just type `eyersee` in the omnibox) to launch the app.

If the above did not make sense then this project is not yet for you.
